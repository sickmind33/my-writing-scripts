A bunch of scripts I use for my writing

When writing short stories, sometimes creativity doesn't cut it. That's where these scripts comes in. Each one serves a purpose for my writing. Here's the short of what each one does. Output will be in console as well as text file.

##Character Maker##  
This script will create a character with height, species, gender, general attitude, and (if female) breast size. This script can be easily modified to suit your own needs.

##Cost Estimation##  
A script that will let you enter a client's name, how many words their story will have, and the cost will be calculated. Output will be in console as well as text file.

##Prompt Generator##  
Creates a writing prompt with a location, two characters, and a conflict.  Creates characters with code from the Character Maker script. This script can be easily modified to suit your own needs.

##Word Count Cost##  
My pride and joy. This script will take a story you are writing, count the words in the story, calculate the cost per word, and output the cost to a text file. Great for writers who livestream and want the cost seen live.
